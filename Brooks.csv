Brooks Chariot Bait Centennial, Brooks, 110178-1D-846, 120, 148, 54, undefined, 637501761cb69837c65302bb, Brooks Chariot, Navy/Green/Red, 2014-11-22, Released on November 22 2014 to celebrate their fourth store location the BAIT x Brooke Chariot "Centennial" was available at BAIT Seattle on a first come-first served basis. As an extra incentive the first 100 people to purchase the shoes or a BAIT x K-Way jacket would be eligible to receive a free K-Way Klaude Klassic Jacket. Per usual BAIT also released a limited number of Centennial Brooks online through their online raffle system. Those selected were contacted with a private link to purchase the BAIT Centennials. Inspired by the Centennial Anniversary of Brooks the Centennial Chariots featured high-grade leather and pigskin suede on the upper in different hues of deep dark blue bluish-green and red. Cutting through the upper is the oversized Brooks logo in off-white giving it the look of a naturally aged white representative of the aging of the Brooks brand itself. "Brooks" is embossed on the rear heel tab and their signature labeling is present on the Chariot Centennial's tongue. The BAIT Centennials came with two pairs of waxed rope and two sets of waxed flat lace. Retailing at $120 the BAIT x Brooks Chariot "Centennial" was a simply yet sophisticated celebration of both Brooks' 100 anniversary and the beginning of the BAIT-Seattle story.
